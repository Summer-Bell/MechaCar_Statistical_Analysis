## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that provided non-random amount of variance are vehicle weight, spoiler_angle and AWD.
Ground_clearance and vehicle_lenght provided the most amount of random variance.


Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
There are indications that the slope of the linear model is not zero because the p-value is less than .05


Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, this model predicts MechaCar prototypes effectively.
The R-squared value is .7149 which means that ~71% of the time the model will predict the mpg correctly.
